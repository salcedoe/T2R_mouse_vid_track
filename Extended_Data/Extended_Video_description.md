Mouse behavior during a recording session. Representative video recordings of wildtype and SCC-pathway knockout mice showing typical behaviors observed during an experimental session of the avoidance assay (one chamber nebulized with denatonium and the other chamber with saline).  Both WT and KO mice do not  lick their fur or the chamber surfaces for the duration of the experiments.
